## Meeting Notes
### Big idea: qualitative data (image)---> quantitative (coordinates) ---> Statistical Analysis
   -After collecting multiple samples (fish brains), we want to quantify and standardize the data
### Data file 
   -Imgae file format:  
     -tif: 3D   
     -hdf5: multidimentional analysis of data  
   -Store image data, 3D stacks of data
### Process
   - First, using Principal Component to adjust/align coordinates
   - Next, Using Dealtascope fit the models
   - Transfer "Cube Data" to "Point Cloud File"
### Point Cloud File
   -Model align with zebrafish brain structure
   -Data points are wraped around the model
   -Data points in comparison to the model
   -Data points in orientation to the model
   -Data move with the model
   -Flatten the data into 2D/line in order to analyze
--commissure?

### What did you do this week?

- Crystal
    - Set up Python environment-Anaconda
    - Tried to download DeltaScope, ran into issue
    - Created a copy of the original deltascope Repository.
- Emma
    - Set up Python environment-Anaconda
- Kalynn
    - Create repos/git related, help others set up
    - Install DeltaScope as is
    - Very BRIEFLY looked at existing code

### What is it that you're struggling with right now?

- Crystal
    - Do not have access to data
    - Can't understand Github code
    - Need to get more information from the in-person meeting with our client on 2/5.
- Emma
    - We will know after we meet up with our client
- Kalynn
    - We will know after we meet up with our client
    - Getting existing Delta Scope to work, need to download needed dependencies, will look further after meeting w client

### What are you planning to do next week?

- Crystal
    - Understand the code
    - Start to run DeltaScope software with the data
- Emma
    - Meeting with our client and set up a plan for the week/coming week
- Kalynn
    - We will know after we meet up with our client
    - Get existing Delta Scope to work?
    - Look further into the code
