## Meeting Notes
### Big idea: qualitative data (image)---> quantitative (coordinates) ---> Statistical Analysis
   -After collecting multiple samples (fish brains), we want to quantify and standardize the data
### Data file 
   -Imgae file format:  
     -tiff: 3D   
     -hdf5: multidimentional analysis of data  
   -Store image data, 3D stacks of data
### Process
   - First, using Principal Component to adjust/align coordinates
   - Next, Using Dealtascope fit the models
   - Transfer "Cube Data" to "Point Cloud File"
### Point Cloud File
   -Model align with zebrafish brain structure  
   -Data points are wraped around the model   
   -Data points in comparison to the model  
   -Data points in orientation to the model  
   -Data move with the model  
   -Flatten the data into 2D/line in order to analyze    

-Goal:commissure align at the origin

### Sharable Data 
   -Share large data file
   -Purpose is to enable other researchers to test on our data
   -Options: github? R package?
   
### Next Step
   -Watch Morgan's video 
   -Follow up to run the program with the data
   -Transfer data to R package
